However, a lot of the different models we have been creating are what we call **regression models**. Today, we'll be talking about another type of modeling: **classification**."

Let's say you ask two different people who already took the exam how hard it was, so you can gauge how hard it might be for yourself. But let's also say between the two people you ask, one is super duper smart and the other is Pass/No-Passing the class. Their perspectives of how difficult the test can be incredibly different from another. The super duper smart person might say the test was pretty easy, which may have been a result of their intellect and the time they put into studying for the exam. The person taking the class Pass/No Pass might think the test was incredibly hard, which may have been a result of them putting in less effort into the class due to the fact that they only need to Pass it."

That person could be a good indicator of how difficult the test might be for you, but asking that one person might not be enough. Let's say you wanted to ask more people in taking the same class what they thought of the exam. You could average out their responses, and get a general gist of how difficult the exam might be for yourself. However, if you continue to keep asking people, you might get to the point where you ask a number close to the size of the class! At that point, how difficult you think the exam might be for you is just how difficult the exam itself was on average. So, we can see that not only are **the types of people you ask** an important to factor consider, but also **the number of people** you ask can affect your result as well."

Their perspectives of how difficult the test can be incredibly different from another. The super duper smart person might say the test was pretty easy, which may have been a result of their intellect and the time they put into studying for the exam. The person taking the class Pass/No Pass might think the test was incredibly hard, which may have been a result of them putting in less effort into the class due to the fact that they only need to Pass it."

Let's say you wanted to ask more people in taking the same class what they thought of the exam. You could average out their responses, and get a general gist of how difficult the exam might be for yourself. However, if you continue to keep asking people, you might get to the point where you ask a number close to the size of the class! At that point, how difficult you think the exam might be for you is just how difficult the exam itself was on average.
